\section{Work, Energy, and the Conservation of Energy}
    For an object traveling in one dimension with a constant net force $F$ and with velocity changing linearly with time ($v \propto t$), we have
    \begin{equation*}
        F \cross (x_f - x_i) = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2
    \end{equation*}
    The quantity $mv^2 / 2$ is called the \textbf{kinetic energy} $K$, while the left side is referred to as the \textbf{work} $W$ done by the force. For forces that are not constant we have
    \begin{equation*}
        W = \int_{x_i}^{x_f}F(x) dx
    \end{equation*}
    To extend to multiple dimensions
    \begin{equation*}
        W = \int_{\va{r}_i}^{\va{r}_f} \va{F} \vdot d\va{r}
    \end{equation*}
    With these new definitions, the first equation of this section can be written as
    \begin{equation*}
        W_{net} = \Delta K = K_f - K_i
    \end{equation*}
    aka the \textbf{work-energy theorem}. A \textbf{conservative force} is a force which the work done by the force is path independent (it only depends on the start and end state).
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_{\va{r}_i}^{\va{r}_f} \va{F} \vdot d\va{r} = f(\va{r}_f) - f(\va{r}_i)
    \end{equation*}
    We define potential energy for these forces as
    \begin{equation*}
        U(\va{r}) = - \int_{\va{r}_0}^{\va{r}} \va{F} \vdot d\va{r} + U(\va{r}_0)
    \end{equation*}
    So $U(\va{r}_f) - U(\va{r}_i) = - \int_{\va{r}_i}^{\va{r}_f} \va{F} \vdot d\va{r}$. We also set \textbf{total energy} to 
    \begin{equation*}
        E \equiv U(\va{r}) + K
    \end{equation*}
    \textbf{Important potential energies}
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{Local Gravity: } U(h) = mgh
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{Local Gravity: } U(h) = mgh
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{Gravitation: } U(r) = - \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}
    \end{equation*}
    Given the potential energy, we can find the force using the gradient
    \begin{equation*}
        \va{F}(\va{r}) = -\va{\grad}U
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
        F(x) = - \frac{dU}{dx} \text{ (in one dimension)}
    \end{equation*}
